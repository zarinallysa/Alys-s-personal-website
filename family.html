<p> This is my big family. I practically live with my grandparents and some of my aunts all of my life, so I'm used to the big and noisy situation. We are close with each other, and what I can say about my family is that all of us are really loud and outgoing. Sometimes my friends will come to my house, and I can feel them being shy and awkward because my family is really straightforward. Fun fact about my family, all of us don't know how to smile while taking a picture, so sometimes the picture will turn out not nice and pretty.

<p> Mama, the love and light of my life. She is my everything, and without her, there is no me. There are no words that can describe her to me. She is my mother and father at the same time. She always tries to fulfill my needs and put her children first. Her love is constant, her patience endless, and her presence comforting. I admire her deeply, and I hope to grow into someone even half as incredible as she is. Mama used to work as a kindergarten teacher, but now she has stopped working because her knees are injured. Because of that, now she helps Abah with sending the children home from school. Mama loves to read, my sister and I got the reading habit from her. She has many novels in her wardrobe to the point that her wardrobe almost collapsed. Because of our love towards reading, we tried to go to PBAKL every year, and so far we have gone for 3 years straight and still counting.

<div class="center-justify">
<p> For me, my siblings are my backbone. They are my go-to call. We always call each other in our free time and just share stories about how our day went. Personally, I think that we are closer now when we all have grown up, because from my memories, we always argued and fought with each other while growing up, especially my sister and I. The reason for that is that our age gap is 5 years, so she would bully me, and I would fight back, but now we rarely argue, maybe due to her being married or that I'm not home.

<div class="center-justify">
<p> My grandparents. They are called Abah and Mak. Abah is very charismatic, and he is the quiet type. Sometimes people will consider him fierce (he is), but he will be fierce only when needed. Maybe people see him as fierce because of his previous job. He is a retired airport firefighter; now he drives a school bus. Even though he is now in his 70s, he doesn't want to stop yet because he will be bored staying at home and doing nothing. Mak is someone who will always fulfill my craving at home. Her cooking is the best, and every time I go back home, I will ask her to cook my favourites, which are nasi ayam and siput sedut masak lemak. Mak is someone who loves to tell stories, either about her life or anything that interests her, and I really enjoy listening to her because her stories always fascinate me.

<p> My one and only nephew (for now). The first thing that made me an aunt, honestly, as a youngest child, I'm not good with kids, and sometimes I find them annoying. But with him, I enjoy taking care of him, even though now he doesn't want to get near me due to I haven't gone home for a long time. So he finds me unfamiliar and is not comfortable being near me.
