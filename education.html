<p>This is where I went for kindergarten, Tadika Sinar Bahru. I attended it when I was 5 and 6 years old from 2010 to 2011. When I was 4 years old, I had already started going to kindergarten. Since my mother was a kindergarten teacher, I would often accompany her to the kindergarten, and I enjoyed playing with the other kids. And because of that, the headmaster there pitied me and allowed me to attend the kindergarten without my mother having to pay the expenses or learn anything. I just spent my time there playing with other kids and following my mother around. 
When I reflect on my kindergarten days, I truly enjoyed them. Because for me, my school had many interesting activities. Apart from the regular class sessions, we had a computer class where we would play games like coloring games on the computer. Besides that, every year, my kindergarten would organize a group trip to the Johor Zoo. I remember I was able to go to the Johor Zoo with my friends, and lucky me, I was also able to go with my mother. Lastly, every year, my kindergarten would organize a graduation ceremony for 6-year-old children. And at the ceremony, there would be performances from the students. I liked performing because I got to go on stage and dress up.</p>

        Sekolah Kebangsaan Senai Utama. This is my elementary school, where I attended from 7 until 12 years old.

<p> During elementary school, I would say that I'm a normal student, where I don't stand out among my peers, I'm not a top grades student, I'm an average score student, and I would mostly spend time with my circle of friends. I didn't enjoy bringing attention to myself at that time. But during grade 4, I started to become active in KOKO. I was in PBSM, Library club, and Senamrobik club, and because of this, I gained the confidence to participate in many KOKO activities. One thing that I really enjoyed and kinda miss is that every time during the sports day, or any sport-related activities, there will be senamrobik before starting the activity. As the leader and the president of the club, I would lead the Senamrobik for everyone on the field. <a href="https://www.facebook.com/sksusj/photos/d41d8cd9/1687929437947001/?locale=es_LA" target="_blank">Image source</a>  </p>

      <p> Sekolah Agama Senai Utama. This is where I go to Sekolah Agama, along with going to Sekolah Kebangsaan, because in Johor, it is mandatory for everyone to attend Sekolah Agama. Some call it KAFA, but I'm used to speaking of it as sekolah agama. (Sadly, I can't find any picture during sekolah agama). <a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo/?fbid=128322223306633&set=a.128322209973301" target="_blank">Image source</a>

<p> In the pictures above are my classmates for 2 years during my SPM era with our class teacher during Form 5. I enjoy my SPM era, because all of my classmates are outgoing and we are close to each other. All of my teachers are also approachable, and we are all very close to our teachers because they have taught us for two years. When I look back on my memories, I really like my high school days. In this school, I was able to learn many new things and meet friends who will always be with me. Although there were some friendships that were broken due to school transfers or fights, I am very grateful because they gave me beautiful memories throughout our friendship, and also the lessons I learned.

        Now, I'm currently continuing my studies in semester 4 in Library Informatics at Universiti Teknologi Mara (UiTM) Kedah. This course is my first choice for my UPU, and honestly, I didn't expect that I would receive this course. So far, I really enjoy my university life,  and surprisingly, I hardly get homesick, though I'm far from home for the first time. Of course, there are times I would cry, stressing over assignments, but with my friends, I get to overcome it because we would stress and cry over it together. I'm really grateful to all of them because they always fill my days with laughter and joy. Sure, sometimes we may fight or be rude to each other, but that's all normal in life as long as we realize our mistakes and apologize.
