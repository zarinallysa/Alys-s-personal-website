        This is Atiqah, or I usually call her Iqa. She is one of my friends whom I still keep in touch with, even if not often.

<div class="center-justify">

<p">She is the one who I considered as my childhood friend. We have known each other since kindergarten until now, but during elementary and early high school, we grew apart due to being in different classes and having our own circle of friends. We met again in Form 4 because I chose a different stream rather than the one set by the school for SPM, and we were able to be in the same class for 2 years. Until now, she is the friend I will look for every time I go back to Johor. We will go out together during my free time, whether it's going out to eat or going to see a movie. Of course, during SPM, we have other friends who are our classmates, but I sadly don't keep in touch with them other than watching their stories update on Instagram. The reason for that is I'm the type that doesn't contact other people, and I also don't know how to chat idly with other people. So Atiqah is the only one that I can still contact, no matter what.

      <p> This is Alya and Ainaa. The three of us are in one circle where we always hang out together. No matter where the location is, we will hang out for hours, usually the go-to place is my house or Alya's house, because our house is located near each other.

<p> Alya is my elementary school friend. We used to be in the same classes since grade 3 until form 2 in high school. For Ainaa, we have known each other because we were in the same class during form 1, and since then, we have been friends. Surprisingly, I'm the first one who approach Ainaa, and after that, I introduce Ainaa to Alya. Both of them are what I consider non-filtered friends, because we can be our true selves with each other without worrying about being judged. We've shared many secrets, and we've gotten to know each other deeply.

        These are Awin and Tasa. They are both my first friends at University. The three of us were destined to be roommates, and lucky us, we found out that we were also in the same diploma program. From that, we became a group of roommates, classmates, and groupmates for assignments.

        Now we are not only a trio, but we have another sunshine added to our trio, which is Bahi. At first, we were not close to her because we were not roommates, even though we are classmates, but our rooms turned out to be close to each other at the Kolej Mahsuri, after finding out we became close together, and now she is my roommate and someone who shares the same interests as me. I enjoy talking about our interests together, and in our house, she is the one who always makes us laugh with her silliness, and every day, she will choose someone to annoy to the point that we can't handle her. They are the reason why I get to enjoy my university life.
